Archie's Undertale Modding Interface is an internal API made for supporting creation of internal modding tools for GameMaker games.

It is used by my other, complete modding tool, Project V, which is in development.

It is written with pure ANSI C compliance in mind, using very little Windows-exclusive features, to provide a flexible-enough codebase for a potential Linux port.

Feel free to use this in your projects, share them even! I'd love to see this being used somewhere.
